The Angelos Project is an effort to bring secure, non-intrusive, private, and non-globalist owned social media platform. We hope to come up with a solution that is secure from intrusion and privacy snorting. This solution is for everyday persons, especially those that have a hard time communicating their thoughts and ideas to their surroundings without being supervised by the big-brother society.

The idea behind this platform is to offer security and privacy without the risks of anonymity. We value privacy over anonymity and integrity over publicity.

We are building a system based on community life and mutual trust between users on the network of communities. Each person, ministry, and church community are supposed to be equal peers with the disadvantage of lack of control over others. What is important is trust, respect, and confidentiality.

Therefore we have developed a platform based on a client app and a server for communicating safely, distributed over multiple communities that are networking and cooperating. Every entity and communication is verified independently by a system of policies for check and balance, that is independently controlled.

### Client and server

The name of the server derives from the koine Greek word for _messenger of divine message_, Ἄγγελος (Angelos). And the client from the phrase Λόγῳ (Logo) which means _word with an intent_.

I intend to develop and release an app for Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, and Android that is for everyday persons to use, also releasing a server for Windows and Linux servers. This software is licensed as open-source and is free to use. That implies that anyone can use it free of charge or limitations but at their own risk.

Because anyone can download the Angelos server software, anyone can set up an available community, with the outcome of many different alternatives of communities to join. As a result, no corporation, organization, or government will be able to control who has access to the network.

Because of the multitude of possible communities, the risk of being a digital outcast is minimal, while each community also can deal with individual perpetrators. Because no-one can hide behind anonymity, people that misbehave will be uncovered, which is the consequence of mutual trust and validation.

### Technicalities

Currently, to set up and use the Angelos server is very complicated, something that will be, improved upon in the future. Also, the Logo app will become much more user friendly.

**Circle of trust**; is a concept that builds upon mutual trust between entities. Every entity that interacts in a community can certify or verify anyone's identity and their trust in them. Because of this, trust is built, and mutuality takes place. Thanks to the circles of trust, new entities can verify the credibility of other entities.

**Certificates**; every entity on a network can issue certificates that are cryptographically signed, and therefore can not be forged. Therefore can falsifications never take place, and integrity is always guaranteed.

**Domains**; every entity has its domain where they can store their private information that can be synced between devices or servers. Everyone is in charge over what information they share with other domains.
